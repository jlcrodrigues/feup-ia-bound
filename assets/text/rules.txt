Bound is a two-player strategy game where players take turns moving one of their four standing stones. Stones move one space orthogonally, and if a stone is surroundedin all sides by an opponent's stones,it's captured. If a position is repeated twice, the game ends in a draw. The game is played on a pentacle shaped board, and the first player to capture a stone wins. Have fun playing Bound with a friend!
