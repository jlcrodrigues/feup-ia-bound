Bound is a two-player strategy game where players take turns moving one of their four standing stones. Stones move trough a neighbor edge, and if a stone is surrounded in all sides by an opponent's stones, it is captured. If a position is repeated twice, the game ends in a draw. The game is played on a pentacle shaped board, and the first player to capture a stone wins. Have fun playing Bound!
